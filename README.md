### Reflection
This was by far the most intense project I have created to date.  I am very proud of the progress I've made with my knowledge of the three main front-end languages in vanilla format.  This application works very well as intended but required a lot of patience and time to implement all of the features correctly.  Planning is becoming more and more important as the projects become larger scale.
